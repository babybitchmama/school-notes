\begin{problem}[2.10]
  Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $n\Z = \{nm \mid m \in \Z\}$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $\bra{n\Z, +}$ is a group.

    \item Show that $\bra{n\Z, +} \cong \bra{\Z, +}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[(i)]
  We verify that $\bra{n\Z, +}$ is a group.

  Let $a, b \in n\Z$. Then $a = nm$ and $b = nk$ for some $m, k \in \Z$. Hence, $a + b = nm + nk = n(m + k)$. Since $m + k \in \Z$, it follows that $a + b \in n\Z$, so $n\Z$ is closed under addition.

  Because addition in $\Z$ is associative, $n\Z$ inherits this property. Thus, for all $a, b, c \in n\Z$, $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.

  The additive identity is $0$, since for any $a \in n\Z$, $a + 0 = a$.

  For any $a = nm \in n\Z$, the additive inverse is $-a = n(-m)$, because $a + (-a) = nm + n(-m) = n(m - m) = 0$.

  Therefore, all group axioms are satisfied, and $\bra{n\Z, +}$ is a group.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[(ii)]
  Define a map $\phi : \Z \to n\Z$ by $\phi(m) = nm$, for all $m \in \Z$. We will show that $\phi$ is an isomorphism.

  For any $m_1, m_2 \in \Z$,
  \[%
    \phi(m_1 + m_2) = n(m_1 + m_2) = nm_1 + nm_2 = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2)
  ,\]%
  so $\phi$ preserves addition and is therefore a homomorphism.

  Suppose $\phi(m_1) = \phi(m_2)$. Then $nm_1 = nm_2$, and subtracting gives $n(m_1 - m_2) = 0$. Since $n \neq 0$ and $\Z$ has no zero divisors, we conclude that $m_1 - m_2 = 0$, or $m_1 = m_2$. Thus, $\phi$ is injective.

  For any $a \in n\Z$, there exists $k \in \Z$ such that $a = nk$. Then $\phi(k) = nk = a$, so $\phi$ is surjective.

  Therefore, $\phi$ is a bijective homomorphism, and hence an isomorphism. We conclude that $\bra{n\Z, +} \cong \bra{\Z, +}$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.19]
  Let $S$ be the set of all real numbers except $-1$. Define $*$ on $S$ by
  \[%
    a * b = a + b + ab
  .\]%
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $*$ gives a binary operation on $S$.

    \item Show that $\bra{S, *}$ is a group.

    \item Find the solution of the equation $2 * x * 3 = 7$ in $S$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[(i)]
  Let $a, b \in S$, so $a \neq -1$ and $b \neq -1$. If $a * b = -1$ then $a+b+ab=-1$,
  which rearranges to
  \[%
    ab + a + b + 1=(a + 1)(b + 1) = 0
  .\]%
  But $a + 1 \neq0$ and $b + 1 \neq0$, so this is impossible. Hence $a * b \neq-1$, and therefore $a * b \in S$. Thus $*$ is a binary operation on $S$.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[(ii)]
  We first check that associativity holds. Notice that for any $a, b, c \in S$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    (a * b) * c &= (a + b + ab) + c + (a + b + ab)c \\
                &= a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc \\
                &= a + (b + c + bc) + a(b + c + bc) \\
                &= a * (b * c)
  .\end{align*}
  So $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$. Thus $*$ is associative.

  The identity element is $0$, since for any $a\in S$,
  \[%
    a * 0 = a + 0 + a \cdot 0 = a \aand 0 * a = 0 + a + 0 \cdot a = a.
  .\]%
  Now fix $a \in S$ and solve $a * b = 0$. The equation $a + b + ab = 0$ can be rewritten as $(a + 1)(b + 1) = 1$, hence
  \[%
    b + 1 = \frac{1}{a + 1}, \quad b = \frac{1}{a + 1} - 1 = -\frac{a}{a + 1}
  .\]%
  Since $a \neq-1$ the denominator $a + 1 \neq 0$, so this $b$ is well-defined and satisfies $b \neq -1$. Notice that
  \[%
    -\frac{a}{a + 1} = -1 \iff a = a + 1 \iff 1 = 0
  ,\]%
  which is false. Therefore, $b \in S$. Because $*$ is commutative, this element is both a left and right inverse of $a$. Therefore every element of $S$ has a two-sided inverse.

  Since $\bra{S, *}$ has associativity, an identity, and two-sided inverses, $\bra{S, *}$ is a group.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[(iii)]
  To solve $2 * x * 3 = 7$ let us first compute $2 * x = 2 + x + 2x = 3x + 2$. Then
  \[%
    (2 * x) * 3 = (3x + 2) + 3 + (3x + 2)\cdot 3 = 3x + 2 + 3 + 9x + 6 = 12x + 11
  .\]%
  Setting $12x + 11 = 7$ gives $12x = -4$, so $x = -1/3$. Since $-1/3 \neq -1$, this solution lies in $S$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.28]
  An element $a \ne e$ in a group is said to have order 2 if $a * a = e$. Prove that if $G$ is a group and $a \in G$ has order 2, then for any $b \in G$, $b' * a * b$ also has order $2$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $a \ne e$ be an element of order $2$ in the group $G$, so $a * a = e$. For any $b \in G$, we consider the element $b' * a * b$ and compute its square:
  \begin{align*}
    (b' * a * b) * (b' * a * b) &= b' * a * (b * b') * a * b \\
                                &= b' * a * e * a * b \\
                                &= b' * a * a * b \\
                                &= b' * e * b \\
                                &= b' * b \\
                                &= e
  .\end{align*}
  Hence, $(b' * a * b)$ has order $2$.

  Therefore, for any $b \in G$, the element $b' * a * b$ also has order $2$. In other words, conjugation by $b$ preserves the order of elements in $G$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.29]
  Show that if $G$ is a finite group with identity $e$ and with an even number of elements, then there is $a \ne e$ in G such that $a * a = e$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $G$ be a finite group with identity $e$ and an even number of elements. Consider the set $G \setminus \{e\}$, which has an odd number of elements.

  For each $a \in G \setminus \{e\}$, let $a'$ denote its inverse. If $a \ne a'$, we can pair $a$ with $a'$, and each such pair contributes two distinct elements to the set. These pairs together account for an even number of elements.

  Since $G \setminus \{e\}$ has an odd number of elements, at least one element must remain unpaired. For this element $a$, we must have $a = a'$, that is, $a * a = e$.

  Because $a \ne e$, we have found a non-identity element $a \in G$ such that $a * a = e$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.30]
  Let $\R^*$ be the set of all real numbers except 0. Define $*$ on $\R^*$ by letting $a * b = |a|b$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $*$ gives an associative binary operation on $\R^*$.

    \item Show that there is a left identity for $*$ and a right inverse for each element in $\R^*$.

    \item Is $\R^*$ with this binary operation a group?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[(i)]
  We need to show that for any $a, b \in \R^*$, the result of the operation $a * b$ is also in $\R^*$. 

  Let $a, b \in \R^*$. Then, $a * b = |a|b$. Since $|a| > 0$ and $b \neq 0$, it follows that $|a|b \neq 0$. Thus, $a * b \in \R^*$.

  Next, we verify associativity. For any $a, b, c \in \R^*$,
  \[%
    (a * b) * c = (|a|b) * c = | |a|b | c = |a||b|c
  .\]%
  Similarly,
  \[%
    a * (b * c) = a * (|b|c) = |a|(|b|c) = |a||b|c
  .\]%
  Since both expressions are equal, $*$ is associative.

  Therefore, $*$ is an associative binary operation on $\R^*$.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[(ii)]
  We need to find a left identity element $e \in \R^*$ such that for all $a \in \R^*$, $e * a = a$. Let $e = 1$. Then,
  \[%
    e * a = 1 * a = |1|a = a
  .\]%
  Thus, $1$ is a left identity.

  Next, we need to find a right inverse for each element $a \in \R^*$. We want to find $b \in \R^*$ such that $a * b = e$. Using the left identity found above, we have:
  \[%
    a * b = |a|b = 1
  .\]%
  Solving for $b$, we get:
  \[%
    b = \frac{1}{|a|}
  .\]%
  Since $|a| > 0$, it follows that $b \neq 0$, and thus $b \in \R^*$. Therefore, every element in $\R^*$ has a right inverse.

  Hence, there is a left identity and a right inverse for each element in $\R^*$.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[(iii)]
  To determine if $\R^*$ with the operation $*$ is a group, we need to check if it satisfies all group axioms.

  We have already shown that $*$ is an associative binary operation on $\R^*$, and that there is a left identity element (1) and a right inverse for each element.

  However, we need to check if the left identity is also a right identity. For any $a \in \R^*$,
  \[%
    a * e = a * 1 = |a| \cdot 1 = |a|
  .\]%
  Since $|a|$ is not necessarily equal to $a$ (for example, if $a = -2$, then $|a| = 2$), the left identity is not a right identity.

  Therefore, $\R^*$ with this binary operation does not satisfy all the group axioms, and hence it is not a group.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.31]
  If $*$ is a binary operation on a set $S$, an element $x$ of $S$ is an \emph{idempotent for} $*$ if $x * x = x$. Prove that a group has exactly one idempotent element. (You may use any theorems proved so far in the text.)
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $G$ be a group with identity $e$. First, e is idempotent since $e * e = e$.

  Now let $x \in G$ be idempotent, so $x * x = x$. Left-multiply this equation by $x'$ and use associativity:
  \[%
    x' * (x * x) = x' * x
  .\]%
  By associativity this is $(x' * x) * x = x' * x$, i.e. $e * x = e$. Hence $x = e$.

  Therefore, the only idempotent in $G$ is the identity $e$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.32]
  Show that every group $G$ with identity $e$ and such that $x * x = e$ for all $x \in G$ is abelian. [Hint: Consider $(a * b) * (a * b)$.]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $a, b \in G$. Since $x * x = e$ for all $x \in G$, it follows that every element is its own inverse; i.e. $x' = x$ for every $x \in G$.

  Consider $(a * b) * (a * b)$. By the hypothesis $(a * b) * (a * b) = e$, so $(a * b)' = (a * b)$. On the other hand, the general inverse formula in any group gives $(a * b)' = b' * a'$. Using $x' = x$ for $a$ and $b$ we obtain $(a * b)' = b' * a' = b * a$. Combining the two expressions for $(a * b)'$ yields $a * b = b * a$. Thus, $G$ is abelian.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.33]
  Let $G$ be an abelian group and let $c^n = c * c * \cdots * c$ for $n$ factors $c$, where $c \in G$ and $n \in \Z^+$. Give a mathematical induction proof that $(a * b)^n = (a^n) * (b^n)$ for all $a, b \in G$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  We will prove by induction on $n$ that for all $a, b \in G$, $(a * b)^n = (a^n) * (b^n)$.

  For $n = 1$, we have $(a * b)^1 = a * b$, and also $a^1 * b^1 = a * b$. Thus, the base case holds.

  Assume that the statement holds for some $k \in \Z^+$, i.e., assume that $(a * b)^k = (a^k) * (b^k)$. We need to show that it holds for $k + 1$. Consider $(a * b)^{k + 1} = (a * b)^k * (a * b)$. By the inductive hypothesis, we have
  \begin{align*}
    (a * b)^{k+1} &= (a * b)^k * (a * b) \\
                  &= ((a^k) * (b^k)) * (a * b) \tag*{(inductive hyp.)} \\
                  &= (a^k * a) * (b^k * b) \\
                  &= a^{k + 1} * b^{k + 1}
  .\end{align*}
  Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all $n \in \Z^+$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.34]
  Suppose that $G$ is a group and $a, b \in G$ satisfy $a * b = b * a'$ where as usual, $a'$ is the inverse for $a$. Prove that $b * a = a' * b$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Starting from the given equation, we can multiply both sides on the left by $a'$:
  \begin{align*}
    a' * (a * b) &= a' * (b * a') \\
    (a' * a) * b &= a' * b * a' \\
    b &= a' * b * a'
  .\end{align*}
  Multiplying both sides on the right by $a$, we have $b * a = (a' * b * a') * a$. Since $a' * a = e$, this simplifies to $b * a = a' * b$. Therefore, $b * a = a' * b$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[2.36]
  Let $G$ be a group with a finite number of elements. Show that for any $a \in G$, there exists $n \in \Z^+$ such that $a^n = e$. See Exercise 33 for the meaning of $a^n$. [Hint: Consider $e, a, a^2, a^3, \cdots, a^m$, where $m$ is the number of elements in $G$, and use the cancellation laws.]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $G$ be a finite group with $m$ elements. Consider the sequence of elements:
  \[%
    e, a, a^2, a^3, \cdots, a^m
  .\]%
  Since $G$ has only $m$ elements, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these elements must be equal. Thus, there exist integers $i$ and $j$ with $0 \leq i < j \leq m$ such that:
  \[%
    a^i = a^j
  .\]%
  Using the cancellation law (which holds in groups), we can multiply both sides on the left by $(a^i)'$, the inverse of $a^i$, to obtain:
  \[%
    e = a^{j - i}
  .\]%
  Letting $n = j - i$, we have found a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$. Thus, for any element $a \in G$, there exists $n \in \Z^+$ such that $a^n = e$.
\end{solution}
