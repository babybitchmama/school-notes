    \item $F$ is injective at each point,
    \item and

\begin{problem}[3.5]
  Let $\S^1 \subseteq \R^2$ be the unit circle, and let $K \subseteq \R^2$ be the boundary of the square of side 2 centered at the origin: $K = \{(x, y) \mid \max(|x|, |y|) = 1\}$. Show that there is a homeomorphism $F : \R^2 \to \R^2$ such that $F(\S^1) = K$, but there is no \emph{diffeomorphism} with the same property. [Hint: let $\gamma$ be a smooth curve whose image lies in $\S^1$, and consider the action of $\dd{F}(\gamma'(t))$ on the coordinate functions $x$ and $y$.] \emph{(Used on p. 123.)}

\begin{problem}[3.8]
  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $p \in M$. Let $\mathcal{V}_pM$ denote the set of equivalence classes of smooth curves starting at $p$ under the relation $\gamma_1 ~ \gamma_2$ if $(f \circ \gamma_1)'(0) = (f \circ \gamma_2)'(0)$ for every smooth real-valued function $f$ defined in a neighborhood of $p$. Show that the map $\Psi : \mathcal{V}_pM \to T_pM$ defined by $\Psi[\gamma] = \gamma'(0)$ is well defined and bijective. \emph{(Used on p. 72.)}
