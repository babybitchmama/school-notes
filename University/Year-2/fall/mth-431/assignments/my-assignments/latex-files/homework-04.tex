\begin{problem}[1.12]
  Let
  \[%
    W = \left\{1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \cdots, 0\right\}
  ,\]%
  with the metric induced from the usual one on $\R$. Let $(X, \metric_X)$ be another metric space. Given a sequence $p_1, p_2, p_3, \cdots \in X$ and a point $\ell \in X$, prove that $p_n \to \ell$ if and only if the map $f : W \to X$ defined by
  \[%
    \begin{cases}
      f(1/n) = p_n, \\
      f(0) = \ell
    \end{cases}
  .\]%

\begin{problem}[3.4]
  Let $S \subset [0, 1]$, and let $A \subset C([0, 1])$ be the set of continuous functions that vanish on $S$ as in Example 3.4. Prove that $A$ is closed in the sup metric.

  Hint: You could prove this directly from the definitions, or you could use Proposition 2.10 and Proposition 1.10 together with Example 1.8(c), which is stated for evaluation at $x = 0$ but which we can see is equally valid for evaluation at any $x \in [0, 1]$.

\begin{problem}[4.1]
  Prove that the sequence of piecewise-linear functions $f_1, f_2, f_3, \cdots \in C([0, 1])$  introduced at the beginning of the section is Cauchy in the $L^1$ metric.

\begin{problem}[4.3]
  Let $p_1, p_2, p_3, \cdots$ be a Cauchy sequence in a metric space $(X, \metric)$. Prove that the sequence is bounded, meaning that there is a point $q \in X$ and a radius $R > 0$ such that $p_n \in B_R(q)$. (In fact, for any $q \in X$ you can find such a radius $R$, and in particular for $X = \R^n$ you can take $q = 0$.)

  Hint: Start by applying the definition of Cauchy with $\epsilon = 1$ to get an $N$ such that if $m, n \ge N$ then $\metric(p_m, p_n) < 1$, and in particular $\metric(p_N, p_n) < 1$.
