\begin{problem}[2.2]
  Define the closed ball
  \[%
    \bar{B}_r(p) = \{q \in X \mid \metric(d, q) \le r\}
  .\]%
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that $\overline{B_r(p)} \subset \bar{B}_r(p)$, that is, the closure of the open ball is contained in the closed ball.

    \item Give an example to show that the inclusion can be strict.

      Hint: You might take $X = \Z$ with the usual metric inherited from $\R$, or any set with a discrete metric (Exercise 1.4).

\begin{problem}[2.4]
  Prove the analogue of Proposition 2.7 for closures, without appealing to Proposition 2.6.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\bar{\bar{A}} = \bar{A}$.

    \item If $A \subset B$, then $\bar{A} \subset \bar{B}$.

    \item $\bar{A} \cup \bar{B} = \overline{A \cup B}$.

    \item $\overline{A \cap B} \subset \bar{A} \cap \bar{B}$

      Give an example to show that the inclusion can be strict.

\begin{problem}[3.1]
  Let $X = \R^2$ with the Euclidean metric. Sketch the subset
  \[%
    A = \{(x, y) \in \R^2 \mid x \ne 0~\text{or}~y = 0\}
  .\]%
  Prove that $A$ is neither open nor closed.

\begin{problem}[3.2]
  In Example 1.4 we saw three different metrics on $\R^2$. Prove one of the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A subset $A \subset \R^2$ is open in the Euclidean metric if and only if it is open in the taxicab metric.

    \item A subset $A \subset \R^2$ is open in the Euclidean metric if and only if it is open in the square metric.

    \item A subset $A \subset \R^2$ is open in the taxicab metric if and only if it is open in the square metric.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[3.3]
  Let $X = \Q$ with the metric induced from the usual one on $\R$: that is, $\metric(x, y) = |x - y|$ for all $x, y \in \Q$, but we're thinking about $\Q$ in itself and forgetting about the rest of $\R$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that the subset
      \[%
        \{x \in \Q \mid x^2 < 1\}
      ,\]%
      is open but not closed.

    \item Prove that the subset
      \[%
        \{x \in \Q \mid x^2 \le 2\}
      ,\]%
      is both open and closed

      (You may use the fact that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational without proving it.)

\begin{problem}[3.5]
  Let $S \subset [0, 1]$, and let $F \subset C([0, 1])$ be the set of continuous functions that vanish on $S$ as in Example 3.4. Prove that $F$ is closed in the sup metric.

  Hint: One possibility is to use Proposition 1.10 together with Example 1.8(c), which is stated for evaluation at $x = 0$ but which we can see is equally valid for evaluation at any $x \in [0, 1]$.
