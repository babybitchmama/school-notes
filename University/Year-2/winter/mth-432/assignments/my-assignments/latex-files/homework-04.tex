\begin{problem}[1]
  Suppose that $L$ is a simplicial complex and $K_1, K_2 \subset L$ are subcomplexes. Show that $\chi(K_1 \cap K_2) = \chi(K_1) + \chi(K_2) - \chi(K_1 \cap K_2)$.

\begin{problem}[2]
  Suppose that $K$ is a simplicial complex, and consider its barycentric subdivision $K^1$. It is true in general that $\chi(K^1) = \chi(K)$, but the proof involves more combinatorial bookkeeping than I want to ask you to do on a homework assignment. Instead, I'm just going to ask you to prove it for complexes of dimension at most 2.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that when $\dim(K) = 1$.
    \item Prove that when $\dim(K) = 2$.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[3]
  Let $X$ be the Klein bottle, and consider the three simple closed curves shown in Figure 7.16 of your book. For each of these curves, determine whether it thickens to a cylinder or a M\"obius strip, and describe the surface obtained by a single surgery. (Note that you can answer this question without thinking about triangulations.)
