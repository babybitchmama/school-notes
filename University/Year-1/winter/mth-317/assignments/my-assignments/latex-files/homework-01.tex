\begin{problem}[4.3.3]
  Supply a proof for Theorem 4.3.9 (Composition of continuous functions) using
  $\epsilon$ - $\delta$ characterization of continuity.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
  Let $f$ be continuous at $c$ and $g$ be continuous at $f(c)$. Let $\epsilon >
  0$ be arbitrary. Pick a $\delta_1 > 0$ such that $\lvert y - f(c) \rvert <
  \delta_1$ implies that $\lvert g(y) - g(f(c)) \rvert < \epsilon$. Pick a
  $\delta_2 > 0$ such that $\lvert x - c \rvert < \delta_2$ implies $\lvert f(x)
  - f(c) \rvert < \delta_2$. Therefore, we get
  \[%
    \lvert x - c \rvert < \delta_2 \implies \lvert f(x) - f(c) \rvert < \delta_1 \implies \lvert g(f(x)) - g(f(c)) \rvert < \epsilon
  .\qedhere\]%
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[4.3.4]
  Assume $f$ and $g$ are defined on all of $\R$ and that $\lim_{x \to p} f(x) = q$ and $\lim_{x \to q} g(x) = r$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Give an example to show that it may not be true that
      \[%
        \lim_{x \to p} g(f(x)) = r
      .\]%

    \item Show that the result in (i) does follow if we assume $f$ and $g$ are continuous.

    \item Does the result in (i) hold if we only assume $f$ is continuous? How
      about if we only assume that $g$ is continuous?

\begin{problem}[4.3.6]
  Provide an example of each or explain why the request is impossible.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Two functions $f$ and $g$, neither of which is continuous at $0$ but
      such that $f(x)g(x)$ and $f(x) + g(x)$ are continuous at $0$.

    \item A function $f(x)$ continuous at $0$ and $g(x)$ not continuous at $0$
      such that $f(x) + g(x)$ is continuous at $0$.

    \item A function $f(x)$ continuous at $0$ and $g(x)$ not continuous at $0$
      such that $f(x)g(x)$ is continuous at $0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution to (i)]
  Define $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as follows
  \begin{align*}
    f(x) &= \begin{cases}
      1 & \textrm{if}~x \ne 0 \\
      1 & \textrm{if}~x = 0
    \end{cases} \\
    g(x) &= -f(x)
  .\end{align*}
  As $x \to 0$, $f(x) \to 0$, but $f(0) = 1$. Similarly, as $x \to 0$, $g(x) \to
  0$, but $g(0) = -1$. Therefore, $f$ and $g$ are discontinuous at $0$.

  Notice that as $x \to 0$, $f(x) + g(x) \to 0$ and $f(x) + g(x) = 0$.
  Therefore, $f(x) + g(x)$ is continuous at $0$. Similarly, as $x \to 0$,
  $f(x)g(x) = -1$ and $f(x)g(x) \to -1$. Therefore, $f(x)g(x)$ is continuous at
  $0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Solution to (ii)]
  Impossible, because the sum of a continuous function and a discontinuous
  function is always discontinuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Solution to (iii)]
  Let $f(x)$ be a constant function at $0$. Then, as long as $g(x)$ is bounded,
  then by exercise 4.2.7, $f(x)g(x) = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[4.3.8]
  Decide if the following claims are true or false, providing either a short
  proof or counterexample to justify each conclusion. Assume throughout that $g$
  is defined and continuous on all of $\R$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $g(x) \ge 0$ for all $x < 1$, then $g(1) \ge 0$ as well.

    \item If $g(r) = 0$ for all $r \in \Q$, then $g(x) = 0$ for all $x \in \R$.

    \item If $g(x_0) > 0$ for a single point $x_0 \in \R$, then $g(x)$ is in
      fact strictly positive for uncountably many points.
  \end{enumerate}
