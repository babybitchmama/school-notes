\begin{problem}[1]

  sum of the diagonal elements of $A$, i.e., $\Tr(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{jj}$.

\begin{problem}[2]
  State the replacement theorem.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
  Let $V$ be a vector space, and let $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ be a linearly
  independent set of vectors in $V$. If $\{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_m\}$ is a spanning
  set of $V$, then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $n \leq m$, and

    \item It is possible to replace $n$ vectors in $\{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_m\}$
      with $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ such that the resulting set still spans
      $V$.\qedhere

\begin{problem}[3]
  Let $V$ be a vector space. Prove that the zero vector in $V$ is unique.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
  \renewcommand\e{\mathbf{e}}\renewcommand\f{\mathbf{f}}
  Let $\e$ and $\f$ be zero vectors in $V$. Since $(\forall \a \in V)[\e \cdot
  \a = \a]$, then, we have $\e \cdot \f = \f$. Since $(\forall \b \in V)[\b
  \cdot \f = \b]$, then, we have $\e \cdot \f = \e$. Therefore, $\e = \f$.

\begin{problem}[10]
  True or False. (No explanation needed).
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A vector space may have more than one zero vector.

    \item If $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree $n$, then $f + g$ is a polynomial of degree $n$.

    \item If $V$ is a vector space and $W$ is a subset of $V$ that is a vector space, then $W$ is a subspace.

    \item If $W$ and $U$ are subspaces of $V$, then $W \cup U$ is a subspace of
      $V$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution to (i)]
  False, since by problem 3, I've shown that the zero vector in a vector space
  is unique.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Solution to (ii)]
  No, take $f(x) = x^2 + x$ and $g(x) = -x^2 + x$. Then, $(f + g)(x) = 2x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Solution to (iii)]
  Yes, by definition, a subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ if it's not empty and
  closed under addition and scalar multiplication. But since $W$ is already a
  vector space, that means it's not empty and closed under addition and scalar
  multiplication, so it's a subspace of $V$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Solution to (iv)]
  No, as it might not be closed under addition or scalar multiplication. For
  example, let $W = \{(x, 0) \mid x \in \R\}$ and $U = \{(0, y) \mid y \in
  \R\}$. Then, $(1, 0) + (0, 1) = (1, 1) \notin W \cup U$.
\end{proof}
