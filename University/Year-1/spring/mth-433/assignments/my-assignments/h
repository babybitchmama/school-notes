You're very close! The first part of your solution (proving Pappus’ Theorem) is excellent — clean, clear, and correct. The second part, however, has a couple of issues, mostly in the application of the parametrization and in how you're using the variables. Let's walk through a corrected and clarified version of part (ii).

---

### 🌟 What’s wrong with your solution in part (ii)?

1. **Parametrization mismatch**: You write \( C(\theta, \phi) = \dots \) as if it's a parametrization of the *torus* directly, rather than of the generating curve \( C \) in the \( xz \)-plane.
2. **Variable confusion**: You use both \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) in the generating curve, which is unnecessary when applying Pappus’ Theorem — it needs only the arc length \( s \) along the generating curve.
3. **Incorrect use of arc length**: You switched from an arc-length-based integral (which is what Pappus’ theorem requires) to a polar integral without ensuring arc-length was respected.
4. **Dropped a factor**: You got the final result as \( 2\pi^2 R \), which is missing the factor of \( r \), the radius of the generating circle.

### ✅ Correct version of part (ii):

Let’s carefully apply **Pappus' Theorem**, which says:

> The area of a surface of revolution is  
> \[
A = 2\pi \int_0^l \rho(s)\,ds
\]  
where \( \rho(s) \) is the distance from the axis of revolution and \( s \) is arc length along the generating curve.

#### Step-by-step:

We’re revolving a circle of radius \( r \), centered at \( (R, 0) \) in the \( xz \)-plane, around the \( z \)-axis.

So the generating curve \( C \) is the circle in the \( xz \)-plane,  
\[
C(\theta) = \langle R + r\cos\theta, 0, r\sin\theta \rangle, \quad \theta \in [0, 2\pi]
\]

This curve is parametrized by angle, not arc length — but since it's a circle, we know its total length is \( l = 2\pi r \), and it’s easy to compute everything explicitly.

The distance from the axis (the \( z \)-axis) at any point on the generating curve is just:
\[
\rho(\theta) = R + r\cos\theta
\]

But we want the **arc length parametrization**, so we must write everything in terms of \( s \). Fortunately, for a circle of radius \( r \), the natural arc length parametrization is:
\[
s = r\theta \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{s}{r}, \quad s \in [0, 2\pi r]
\]
So,
\[
\rho(s) = R + r\cos\left( \frac{s}{r} \right)
\]

Now apply Pappus’ theorem:
\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^{2\pi r} \left[ R + r\cos\left( \frac{s}{r} \right) \right] ds
\]

Split the integral:
\[
A = 2\pi \left[ \int_0^{2\pi r} R\,ds + \int_0^{2\pi r} r\cos\left( \frac{s}{r} \right) ds \right]
= 2\pi \left[ R \cdot 2\pi r + r \cdot \int_0^{2\pi r} \cos\left( \frac{s}{r} \right) ds \right]
\]

Use substitution: \( u = \frac{s}{r} \Rightarrow ds = r\,du \), \( u \in [0, 2\pi] \):
\[
\int_0^{2\pi r} \cos\left( \frac{s}{r} \right) ds = r \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(u) du = r \cdot 0 = 0
\]

So:
\[
A = 2\pi \cdot R \cdot 2\pi r = 4\pi^2 R r
\]

---

### ✅ Final boxed answer:

\[
\boxed{A = 4\pi^2 R r}
\]
