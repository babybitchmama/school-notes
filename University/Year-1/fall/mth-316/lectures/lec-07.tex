\nte[Section 2.3]{Oct 16 2024 Wed (13:01:48)}{Algebraic and Order Limit Theorem}

\begin{definition}[Bounded]
  A sequence $(x_n)$ is \textit{bounded} if there exists a number $M > 0$ such
  that $\lvert x_n \rvert \le M$ for all $n \in \N$.
\end{definition}

Geometrically, this means that we can find an interval $[-M, M]$ that contains
every term in the sequence $(x_n)$.

\begin{theorem}
  Every convergent sequence is bounded.
\end{theorem}
