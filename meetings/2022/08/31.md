# Meeting with Stephen Arthur (stephen.arthur@pcc.edu)

## Why

## Time: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

### Questions

1. Could you explain how everything works? Like, what committees do what and
   their differences.
2. Could you explain what the **senate** does?
3. Could you explain the difference between the **senate** and **student
   government**?
4. I've already got the form for the student leadership done. Do I still need
   that or do I have to submit only the senate form?
5. Is it possible that I could have an extension on the **senate** form because
   it took me a while to fill out the **student leadership** form. I'm afraid I
   might not be able to submit the form in time.
6. What happens if I don't submit the form in time?
7. Regarding locations, where will everything take place? Do they take place at
   certain locations, or do they vary based on the actual event?
