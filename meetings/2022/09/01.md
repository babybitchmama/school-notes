# Meeting with Ruqaiyah Damrah (ruqaiyah.damrah@yale.edu)

## Why

Her and I are going to go over the form I need to complete and submit. I've
got two forms. The Student Leadership and The Student Senate. I hope by the end
of today, I'll complete the first one because they're both due by today. But,
my meeting with the guy in charge said if I can't submit both of them by the
end of today, he'll give me an extension until Friday. On Friday, I'll just
email him my forms.

## Time: 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM

### Notes
